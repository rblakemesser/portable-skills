# Skill Pattern Contract

This file is the contract for what a strong skill must contain, what it must not do, and where each kind of guidance belongs.

## Ordered design flow

1. **Job to be done and leverage claim**
   - Name the repeated user problem and the improved world state the skill should create.
2. **Canonical use cases and one anti-case**
   - Capture 2-3 exact user asks the skill should handle and one similar ask it should reject.
3. **Mechanism choice**
   - Decide whether this belongs in a skill, prompt, `AGENTS.md`, plan doc, or ordinary documentation.
4. **Trigger description**
   - Write the `description` so it explains what the skill does, when it should fire, and what nearby work is out of scope.
5. **Runtime-specific machine behavior**
   - Encode host-specific invocation, gating, or command behavior in frontmatter or supported machine-readable fields rather than hiding it in prose.
6. **Core runtime contract**
   - Put the durable workflow, boundaries, and output expectations in `SKILL.md`.
7. **Progressive disclosure**
   - Move detailed doctrine, schemas, examples, and audits into `references/`.
8. **Determinism only when earned**
   - Add `scripts/` only when natural-language execution keeps failing or the same code is being re-authored repeatedly.
9. **Validation**
   - Test trigger quality, package integrity, and real execution separately.

## What makes a skill high impact

A skill earns its existence when it changes how the agent performs a repeated class of work, not merely how a document is worded.

Strong leverage usually comes from one or more of these:

- the workflow has multiple steps or non-obvious ordering
- good results depend on context the model will not reliably reconstruct unaided
- the task needs bundled references, schemas, or tooling instructions
- the same reasoning or packaging mistakes recur across requests
- a durable skill reduces repeated prompt-writing and makes a shared quality bar portable

A skill is usually low leverage when:

- it restates generic advice the model already knows
- it is only a thin wrapper around one one-off command
- the workflow is mostly repo-local policy that belongs in `AGENTS.md`
- the package exists only because the folder structure feels tidy

## Packaging ownership by file type

- `SKILL.md`
  - Owns the trigger contract, required frontmatter, use boundaries, non-negotiables, workflow, and reference map.
- `references/`
  - Own detailed doctrine, examples, schemas, evaluation criteria, and deeper guidance that should load only when needed.
- `scripts/`
  - Own deterministic transforms, validators, or repeated logic that natural language handles poorly.
- `assets/`
  - Own files used in outputs, not background reading.
- `agents/openai.yaml`
  - Own UI metadata, default prompt text, and invocation policy when that metadata adds real value.

If a file does not clearly own something the runtime needs, it probably should not exist.

## Fatal anti-patterns

Never ship a skill that relies on:

- folder-first design with no real use cases
- vague or marketing-style descriptions that overtrigger or undertrigger
- giant umbrella scope that hides multiple unrelated workflows in one package
- heuristic rulebooks, slogans, or finite lists standing in for reasoning
- runtime dependence on external repo docs, hidden notes, or local prompt packs
- bloated `SKILL.md` files that should have been split into references
- decorative scripts added before proving the need for determinism
- auxiliary packaging clutter like in-skill `README.md`, changelogs, or process diaries

The test is simple:

- Would the skill still make sense if you removed the folder name and looked only at the use cases?
- Could the description accidentally match generic writing or planning work?
- Does the skill teach why and when, or only recite what?
- Could another repo install this skill and still use it without missing context?

If the answer is bad, the package is probably teaching cargo cult, not capability.

## Symptom-to-fix map

If the problem is:

- the skill loads at the wrong times: fix the `description`, scope boundaries, and maybe `allow_implicit_invocation`
- the skill never loads for obvious asks: strengthen the `description` with clearer user-language triggers
- the skill loads correctly but executes poorly: fix `SKILL.md`, the workflow, or add a script if the failure is deterministic
- the skill feels huge or muddy: narrow the use cases, split reference material, or split the skill entirely
- the skill depends on repo trivia: move that material to `AGENTS.md` or bundle only the reusable part
- the package contains many files with little runtime value: delete them and keep the ownership model strict
- examples feel like the real rulebook: extract the principle upward and demote the examples back to illustrations

## Final self-check

- Is the repeated user problem concrete and worth a reusable skill?
- Are 2-3 canonical use cases and one anti-case obvious?
- Is the `description` precise enough to control triggering?
- Are runtime-specific invocation and gating rules encoded in machine-readable form where the host supports them?
- Does `SKILL.md` contain only the durable contract and workflow?
- Are detailed examples and doctrine in `references/` instead of bloating the entrypoint?
- Are scripts present only because they add real deterministic value?
- Is the runtime package self-contained?
- Could a reviewer explain why this is a skill rather than a prompt or repo note?
- Does the skill teach underlying lessons instead of short-circuiting judgment with heuristics?
